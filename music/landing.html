<!-- I've studied classical composition and jazz in college and grad school. I performed eastern European traditional music with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3XW5ztA0y8">the Tamburitzans</a>, a folk ballet, and I've toured extensively playing DIY experimental noise music. <br><br>The music I write and recordings I make sound exactly as you'd expect them to given this weird set of experiences. Hope you love them.  -->
