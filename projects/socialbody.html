I want to know if social media can be something psychologically positive. There's a tradition in Theravadan Buddhism called Satipatthana, which roughly equates to the impartial observation of bodily and psychological sensations. If the addictive capacities of social media can be harnessed to the end of impartial observation of senses it may be a way to increase psychological well-being. To experiment with this, I created <a href="http://bodytalk.blue" target="_blank">bodytalk</a>, a social network for the body.
