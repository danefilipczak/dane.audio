I want to know why humans have such a difficult time feeling empathy for our living relatives. A contributing factor might be perceptual bias - we have difficulty identifying with what we can't see and experience directly. I'm exploring how data visualization strategies might ameliorate this, starting with a <a href="http://dane.audio/holocene" target="_blank">mapping app</a> that visualizes the "cutting edge" of the anthropocene extinction - those species that the IUCN designates critically endangered.
